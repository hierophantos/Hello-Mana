* Hello Mana Card Game (Prolog)

A simple two-player card game with Prolog, where each player draws and plays cards to accumulate mana. The first to reach 20 mana wins.

** Game Rules
- Each player starts with a shuffled deck of 30 cards (mana values 1–5, weighted distribution).
- Both players draw 3 cards for their initial hand.
- On your turn, draw a card, then play the highest value card in your hand.
- The played card’s mana value is added to your mana count; the card then goes to your discard pile.
- Players alternate turns. The first turn for player 1 skips the draw step.
- First player to reach 20 or more mana wins.
