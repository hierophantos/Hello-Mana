## Game Rules

-   Each player starts with a shuffled deck of 30 cards (mana values 1â€“5, weighted distribution).
-   Both players draw 3 cards for their initial hand.
-   On your turn, draw a card, then play a card in your hand.
-   The played cardâ€™s mana value is added to your mana count; the card then goes to your discard pile.
-   Players alternate turns. The first turn for player 1 skips the draw step.
-   First player to reach 20 or more mana wins.
